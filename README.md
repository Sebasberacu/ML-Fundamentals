# Prediction of Poverty Levels in Costa Rican Households
This project aims to apply data mining and machine learning techniques to predict poverty levels in Costa Rican households. It employs a dataset called “Costa Rican Household Poverty Level Prediction”, obtained from a competition in Kaggle, which contains detailed information on socioeconomic characteristics of Costa Rican households.

The data mining process follows the CRISP-DM methodology, which includes the following stages:

1. Business Understanding: project objectives are established, such as improving accuracy in classifying households into poverty levels, and business success criteria are defined.
2. Understanding the Data: An initial exploration of the data is conducted to understand its structure and quality. Important variables are identified and data quality is verified, preparing the data for analysis and modeling.
3. Data Preparation: Data cleaning, transformation and selection processes are carried out to adequately prepare the data for training machine learning models.
4. Modeling: Several machine learning models are trained, including **Logistic Regression**, **Support Vector Machines**, **KNN** and **Random Forest**. Cross-validation techniques are applied to evaluate the performance of the models and select the most suitable one.
5. Selection Criteria and Conclusions: The results of the models are compared with the established business objectives and success criteria. The viability of the models is evaluated and the success of the project is concluded.

The analysis carried out during the project has identified important variables related to poverty levels in Costa Rican households. Although the machine learning models did not reach the desired accuracy, the information gathered and the analyses performed provide a solid basis for future research on poverty in Costa Rica and the effectiveness of different approaches to address this social problem.
